As a #a pilot serving on the air home front, #p proved outstanding valor while leading his unit over #t, on #d. On this occasion, #p aggressively engaged an outnumbering enemy raiding force with complete disregard for his personal safety, and successfully accomplished his assigned mission in the face of deadly opposition, inflicting heavy damage upon the aggressors. His extraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty reflect great credit upon himself, and play a noticeable part in building up the finest traditions of our young #s.
