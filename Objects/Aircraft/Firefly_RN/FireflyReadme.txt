Fairey Firefly Mk.5 Beta version
================================

Description:
============
This is a Fairey Firefly Mk 5 add-on for "Strike Fighters: Project 1" and "Wings Over Vietnam". The model represents a post-WWII Mk 5 as used during the Korean war by the navies of the UK and Australia. The Firefly was a versatile and successful carier-borne aircraft, extensively used in ground attack and interdiction roles in Korea. This model carried a large wing-mounted searchlight pod for night missions (hit Cntrl L to operate the searchlight).

The model is by Simon. It is a beta with a few things still to fix, but works fine and looks pretty good. Thanks to Gramps for the skin, Charles for the flight model, data files and screens, and Kesselbrut for the cockpit.
