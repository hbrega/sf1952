Immediately after the end of World War II, the Argentinean Air Force began a process of modernization, incorporating aircraft such as the Gloster Meteor jet fighter, thus becoming the first air force in Latin America equipped with jet-propelled aircraft. In addition, a number of Avro Lincoln and Avro Lancaster bombers were acquired, creating a powerful strategic force in the region. Although the acquisition of the Lancasterâ€™s may have also been seen as a stopgap solution until the Lincolns arrived. They were received in June 1947, 15 Lancasters (registered B-031 to B-045) previously operated by RAF.
