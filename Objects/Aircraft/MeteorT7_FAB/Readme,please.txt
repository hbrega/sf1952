Avions Fairey modified 20 Belgian Air Force F.4s to T.7 standard.

CREDITS:

- Veltro 2k for the plane;

- Charles for original T.75 works and textures I tailored on T.7 to make new temps for it;

- Nesher for kind IDF consultings;

- Coupi for French dressings;

- paulopanz skin & decal works as usual.


The parrot-like FAB skins are mostly for our friend Denis Oliveira pleasure.


Enjoy
