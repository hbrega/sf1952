FM/AI README FOR BUNYAPS SEAHAWK WITH SF-2 TWEAKS BY BAFFMEISTER.
   July, 2010.

  Main issues I tried to address were high AI takeoff and landing speeds for the type, some minor taxi issues, AI pitch oscillations, high rack weight and load capacity for the weapon stations and AI carrier landing issues. Unfortunately, I couldn't fix these by just using the AI DATA entries, I had to mess with the FM. My knowledge of aerodynamics and ThirdWires' flight engine is quite limited. You have been warned.

  TAXI ISSUES: Tested the Sea Hawk on my quicker takeoff mod which can bring out the worst of any airplane and it did quite well. A bit of nose high dancing and some lateral twitching. To stop the nose high issue I added some weight forward on the C/G. This caused the nose wheel to sink into the runway so I shortend the nose gear shock stroke. The spring and damping factors have also been adjusted. To reduce the twitching I increased the rolling radius on the right main landing gear. This is usually reserved for the worst of the bouncing planes but here it is being used for fine tuning. No idea why this works so well. It may be that a small error gets built into the aircraft lod but whatever causes the problem, the game is very sensitive to it and the differential rolling radius fix seems to be the only thing that works on some airplanes.

  WEAPON STATIONS: The rack weight seemed very high on this airplane compared to others. It has been reduced. Also the carrying capacity seemed very high on all of the stations so they have been reduced. Paulopanz has a very interesting weapon station chart for this airplane that included triple rack 25LB rockets on some of the versions but that is way beyond anything I can do. According to the chart some versions could carry 1000lb bombs so that is included. Given the rather poor thrust to weight ratio on this airplane you probably don't want to carry more than 2000lb anyway. Didn't see any reference to rocket pods for this airplane so that capability has been removed. [ very light research done. Weaponeers should get in touch with Paulopanz if you have some info.]
   NOTE: During testing Spillone104 noticed the left wing was heavy on the Sea Hawk when it is carrying rockets. No typos can be found in the Data.ini so the problem is probably in the lod. The problem is confined to rocket stations 4. This position is shared with the outer bomb racks so the work around is to carry bombs in that position when player flown. The A.I. has no problems carrying rockets in that position.
 
  PITCH OSCILLATIONS/CARRIER LANDINGS etc: These items are all mixed up together so I won't try to explain, just highlight. 
  1. Stall and landing speeds reduced.
  2. CLO and CLA numbers for the stabilizer increased.
  3. Lift removed from the flaps. 
  4. Elevator travel increased. 

  GENERAL NOTES: I thought the stock FM was great fun to fly and managed to do a low altitude stall with 2 secondary stalls and a scrape off the ground on my first test flight. [mixing it up with some MiG-17's.] This version is "tighter" in pitch response and maybe a bit less fun. The approach speed for the AI is similar to the A-4B now but when player flown higher is better. The AI needs the low approach speed to land on the aircraft carriers consistently. Carrier trials were done on Hinchinbrookes' HMS Ark Royal. The rocket attack AI has been set up using the add-on 60lb rockets. The dive bomb AI was done by someone else and seems to work fine. Other AI data is just to accommodate the rather poor performnce of the Sea Hawk. Any input appreciated, just PM me at CombatAce. Cheers!
