Supermarine Spitfire PR Mk.XI

The first recon spitfire in use with RAF, RNoAF and RDAF in '50.

3 new skins included, each with historical decalset

The plane is from TMF & Wrench (see original readme for WW2 version)

what's new

- cockpit now close automatically at take-off and it's fully animated from inside too (following cliff's hints for Spitfires IX);

- added pylon via fake pilot is plane specific and painted;

V.1.1: pilot and fake pilot (centerline pylon) fixed; new tank
       
That's all.

Enjoy.
