SF2 WW2 ETO Photo-Recon Spitfires Pak				7/28/2013

 -- Something for the WW2 ETO players --

= For SF2 ONLY, Full-5 Merged (Reccomended/Preferred) =

**SF2:E Expansion Pak 2 =REQUIRED= to get the Spitfire 9c**

This pak contains 2 versions of Photo Recon Spitfires as used in the ETO in WW2. By inference, the PR.XI may also have been used in other theatres, MTO and/or PTO (CBI), but research has not turned up any confirmations of CBI usage.

Inside you'll find:

Spitfire FR.IXC (based on the 3W 9c)
Spitfire PR.XI (based on TMF/MM Mk.VIII)

The PR.XI comes with 2 skins, one tagged (genericlly) for 1 PRU squadron, although research has shown they were also used by No.541 and/or No. 542 Squadrons. The other for the 17th PRS, 7th PRG of the US 8th AF. Serial numbers for the AAF skin are 100% historically accurate. 
The 2 RAF skins serials are more 'generic' in nature. All aircraft are finished in PRU Blue (FS matched as close as possible).
The PR.IX uses all decals for marking; the PR.XI has the national markings painted on, but serials are decals.

In game, on the Aircraft Selection Drop-Down you'll them listed as:

Spitfire FR.IX (3W)
Spitfire PR Mk.XI (TMF)

This will diferentiate them for any/all other PR Spitfire that may exist.

The FR.IXC, by it's very name, retains all it's fighter armament, and 'carries' only the the single oblique camera. The PR.XI is completly unarmed, but retains (non-historically) it's cockpit gunsight.

The canopy is activated via the Standard Animation Keystroke (tm), Shift/0
Weapons (drop tanks), pilot figures (included 'fake pilot' center pylon for the PR.XI) and the AvHistory Merlin sound are included.

As always, fairly easy to follow, yet detailed install instructions are included. So, please read them. Also, give the "Notes" section a read too.

Happy Landings!!


------------------------------------------------

=TO INSTALL:

As I always reccomend, unzip the "sf2_eto_pr-spitfire_pak.zip" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere else that's easy to find

Then, simply, copy/paste the Objects folder supplied directly =OVER= your existing /Objects folder.

Copy/Paste the supplied Sounds folder directly OVER your existing /Sounds folder
 
You'll may be asked "OVERWRITE?", just say Yes. 

I've already seperated out the various folders (Aircraft, Decals, etc), so they'll drop right where they're supposed to be.

Notes:

The research books I used were EXCEEDINLY unclear if the FR.IX used the standard or clipped wing. The aircraft itself was desinged for medium and low level recce; I chose to use the standard C type wing; full span. If more information becomes available, it's a simple matter to switch the lod pointers, as the 3W Spits are mapped identically.

The "camera ports" are painted on all skins.

Recon mission profiling is still 'rather stupid' in game -- the PR.XI is designed for HIGH altitude recon, approximatley 20,000 feet. To acccurately portray this, in game, you MAY need to fly the entire mission by hand, and climb up to operational altitude, again by hand, instead of using the autopilot.
For the FR.IX, the regular ingame recon profile is correct.

Be aware, as the FR.IX uses a modified stock 3W Spit9c data ini, each and every patch/DLC MAY make changes in it. You may have to extract a new one -every time the games are patched/DLCed- and transfer my changes over to that one.
I will =NOT= be constantly updating and uploading changes due to patching screwing things up. The onus is on YOU, the End User (tm)


Changes:
