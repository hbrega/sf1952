ARA General Belgrano was an Argentine Navy light cruiser in service from 1951 until 1982. 
Originally commissioned by the U.S. as USS Phoenix, she saw action in the Pacific theatre
of World War II before being sold by the United States Navy to Argentina.
Transferred to Argentine Navy as Diecisiete de Octubre, 9 April 1951, renamed ARA General Belgrano 1956.
The vessel was the second to have been named after the Argentine founding father Manuel Belgrano (1770–1820).
She was sunk on 2 May 1982 during the Falklands War by the Royal Navy submarine Conqueror with the loss of 323 lives.
Losses from General Belgrano totalled just over half of Argentine military deaths in the war. 
She is the only ship to have been sunk during military operations by a nuclear-powered submarine.
Sister shipi Nueve de Julio (ex USS Boise) served in Argentine Navy from 1951 to 1978
