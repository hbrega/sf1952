The Ariete main battle tank has been developed by the Iveco-Fiat and Oto Melara. Iveco Fiat has carried out the development of the tank and Oto Melara the development of the turret and weapon systems. 
Ariete is in service with the Italian Army. The first tank was delivered in 1995 and final delivery of the 200 tanks ordered took place in August 2002. Ariete was first deployed in Iraq in 2004. 

This is my first 3D model,take patience, with your help the next projects will be better.

Installation:                  

Unzip to a temp director,than move the entire Ariete folder into the /groundobjects folder.
That's it!!

Good hunting!
