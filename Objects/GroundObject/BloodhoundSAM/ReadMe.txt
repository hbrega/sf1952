BloodhoundSAM

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Installation is a 2 part process

First part is to drop the entire BloodhoundSAM folder into your GroundObject folder . 

Second part is to add the missile for the launcher . Copy all files from the weapons folder into your weapons folder located in your game root folder / objects / weapons . Next is to add the new weapon data to the game WEAPONDATA.ini file using the usual method .Then use the weapons editor to open and save the new addition , Thats it . hope you all find some use for this little mod .
The Bloodhound sam is set to be a mobile AAA unit just so they show up more in game , if you have any issues they can be changed in the data .ini to be set as STATIC_SAM .

Thanks to all at CombatAce for allowing me to upload this file ,

Cheers .
