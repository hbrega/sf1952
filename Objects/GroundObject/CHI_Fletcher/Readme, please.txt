USS Fletcher Destoyer Class

The Fletcher class was a class of destroyers built by the United States during World War II.
The class was designed in 1939, as a result of dissatisfaction with the earlier destroyer 
leader types of the Porter and Somers classes.
Some went on to serve during the Korean War and into the Vietnam War.
The United States Navy commissioned 175 Fletcher-class destroyers between 1942 and 1944.
after World War II ended, 11 were sold to countries that they had been built to fight against:
Italy, Germany, and Japan, as well as other countries, where they had even longer, distinguished careers.
