All, troops. This here is the readme for the M-59 armored personell carrier.

 What I did was use the existing M-113's 'body', as the 59 was very close in shape and size. I used the M-55 quad 50s as the base for the guns, but using only one barrel. As there is no moving pintle mounted gun visible, and mostly we won't be watching them [yeah, right!] a little "suspension of disbelief" in necessary.  The 'gun' appears to swivel, as the visible point of firing moves around, tracking targets.

 The vehicle is set as a "TANK" ground object, so it will engage and fire upon other ground objects. It should also appear in CAS missions, on which ever side is using them.

I've also included a mission, edited from Geo's Sherman vs Panther, to let you see them in action.

----- Installation Instructions:

Unzip the m59.ini and m59data.ini into either a temp folder or directly into the /Objects folder. Since this vehicle makes use of the existing bmp and lods of the M-113, these are not included.

If you haven't already done so, extract the "GROUNDOBJECTS.INI" from the objects cat.
Where XXX is the next number in sequence, add the following:

[ObjectXXX]
ObjectName=M59
ObjectFullName=M59 APC
ObjectDataFile=M59_data.ini

With any luck, the game engine will place them as it wants for you to either blow up or protect!

That is all, troops.  Carry on
