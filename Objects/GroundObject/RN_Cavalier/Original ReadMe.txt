For SF/Wo* and SF2 series (All, Merged or Not) --

This is Hinch's WW2 era/post-war era Royal Navy destroyer.

The original readme is below, with historical data.

-------------------
To Install:

Unzip, as always reccomended, to a temp folder or you desktop, which ever is easier. Then, simply copy/paste the /Cavailer folder into the /GroundObject folder of your game install of choice.

The main gun has been changed to the stock 5 inch, so no weapons/gun pack is needed

With special thanks to Hinchbrook for clarifying correct ownership.

With some repainting, can be used to represent other classes of DDs (if you don't look to closly)


Enjoy!

Hinchbrook's Original Readme:

Model/texture:	Hinchinbrooke

Data.ini Advice:	Capun

The war standard "C" class (constructed at the end of WWII) was made up of 4 sub-groups (names beginning with Ca, Ch, Co and Cr).  Completed in 1944, Cavalier escorted Arctic convoys and saw action off Norway.  In 1945, after the end of the war in Europe, she joined the Pacific Fleet.  In 1957, Squid anti-submarine mortars were fitted and she joined the Far East Fleet.  In 1962 she saw action in Brunei in defense of the Sultan and his kingdom.  In 1967 she patrolled Beira for the United Nations.  Cavalier was decommissioned in 1972.  She is preserved at Chatham's historic naval base.

2.  Place the "Cavalier_data.ini" file into the "Objects" directory within SF.
