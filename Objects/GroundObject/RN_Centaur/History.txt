HMS Centaur was the first of the four Centaur-class light fleet carriers of the Royal Navy.
She was the only ship of her class to retain the original configuration with a straight axial flight deck rather
than the angled flight decks of her three sister ships
Between 1956–1958 she underwent extensive modernisation with a six degree angled flight deck being added as well
as steam catapults and arrestor cables giving her the ability to operate jet aircraft, such as the Hawker Sea 
Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom, and after the 1960 Portsmouth refit the de Havilland Sea Vixen and Supermarine
Scimitar.
During the crisis in Aden, from 1963 onwards, Sea Vixens from HMS Centaur launched strikes on rebellious tribesmen
in the Radfan during Operation Damon. In 1964, a mutiny occurred in Tanganyika.
