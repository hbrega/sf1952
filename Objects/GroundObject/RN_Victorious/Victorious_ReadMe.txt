HMS Victorious (R38).  Modernized "Illustrious" class fleet carrier.

Model/texture:	Hinchinbrooke
Help:			Gramps, Capun

Of the "Illustrious" and "Indefatigable" carrier classes, Victorious was the only one that underwent post-war modernization to cope with the increasing size and weight of the new, jet aircraft entering service.  In Portsmouth dockyard, she was stripped almost to her keel, lengthened and then rebuilt; a process that took some eight years.  She emerged in 1958 with fully angled deck, steam catapults and very effective radar suite, which allowed her to serve successfully for another decade.  With the wind-down of FAA conventional forces, a minor fire during refit allowed the government to put her up for disposal and eventual scrapping.

Installation:

1.  Place the "R38Victorious" folder into the "Objects" directory within SF.
2.  Place the "R38Victorious_data.ini" file into the "Objects" directory within SF.
3.  Add these lines to the "groundobjectdata.ini" file (which needs to be extracted, using the extracting gizmo):

	[Objectxxx]........"xxx" being the next number in sequence
	ObjectName=R38Victorious
	ObjectFullName=HMS Victorious
	ObjectDataFile=R38Victorious_data.ini

	(see also Capun's visual guide on installation, posted on the SimHQ forum).
