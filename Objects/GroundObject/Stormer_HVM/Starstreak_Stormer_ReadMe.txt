Introduction
------------
The British Starstreak SAM and the Alvis Stormer HVM launcher.

Starstreak is a British short range surface-to-air missile manufactured by Thales Air Defence Limited (originally Shorts Missile Systems), in Belfast. It is also known as Starstreak HVM where HVM stands for "High Velocity Missile". After launch the missile accelerates to approximately Mach 3.5, at which point it launches three laser beam riding submunitions. The use of three submunitions increases the likelihood of a successful hit on the target. Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997.

Concerning the missile, two adaptations had to be performed in order to overcome the TW engine limitations and get a similar Pk (kill probability):
	+ Guidance changed to all-aspect IR homing completely immune to countermeasures (as the real system).  The game engine seems to use a "pursuit" (no lead bias) technique for laser guided weapons while the real system "leads" the target with the laser beam in order to guide the submunitions to the predicted intercept point.
        + A higher max G.  Again the game engine precludes the weapons from maneuvering during the first instants of the trajectory.  Therefore, the changes in trajectory must take place at later and a higher speed; a higher G load is needed to compensate for this.

Requirements
------------
Nothing.

Installation
------------
