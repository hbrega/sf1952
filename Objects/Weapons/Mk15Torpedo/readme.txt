New  MK13 Torpedo model.. I would suggest first making a backup copy of the original. Installing: Simply copy over the Mk13.jpg and the MK13 Torpedo.LOD into the MK13 torpedo folder in your objects/Weapons folder. Template included to do better skin.

As usual only to be used as Freeware . Under no circumstances shall it be used alone or as part of any pay ware Mod.
