SF2 WW2 PBY-5A Catalina by Veltro2K						5/1/2013

= For SF2, (Full 5 RECCOMENDED!!!) =

**NOTE: due to the EXTENSIVE modifications performed on the various inis, this mod will !!Absolutely!! =NOT= work in SF/Wo* game at any patch level. A FUll 5 Merged install is required, due to the use of SF2NA statements in the data ini, pertaining to Naval Search and Naval Strike.**

This is a Re-release of the Veltro2k's WW2 PBY-5A Catalina flying boat patrol bomber aircraft.
While the Game Engine (tm) dosent support amphidexterious operations off water, the wing floats extend/retract with the H (arrestor hook) key.

This pack contains just the single skin, USN42. This is a rather 'generic' skin, and represents USN VP squadrons from approximately April/May 1942, when the red ball and rudder stripes were removed. This also -more or less- coincides with the the arrival in greater strentgh in squadron service, of the -5A amphibian version (which this is), replacing the -4 and -4 seaplane only variant.
Other skins ARE needed; the template for this aircraft should be available still in the SF/Wo* 1stGen downloads section. If not, I'll upload my copy. (we could use RNFAA, RNZAF, USN 3-tone and overall Black for the "Black Cats")

As always, fairly easy to follow, detailed install instructions are included. PLEASE read them!!!  Also, give the "Note" section a read, in particular on operational usage.
The Legal Statement has been changed with regards to this aircraft.
For those that still have the original releases, you SHOULD redownload this pak; . There HAVE been MANY changes and additions in several of the inis, in respect to SF2NA.

**These aircraft herein are released in "AS IS" Condition.  Any and all issues/problems that cannot be solved via ini edits will exist forever, as new models are unlikely to be created**.

Happy Landings!

==========
To Install:

As always reccomended, unzip the "sf2_ww2_pby_remod_pak" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere that's easy to find.

Copy/Paste the /Objects folder DIRECTLY into the SF2 game install of choice's /Objects folder. It's already divided into the /Aircraft and /Decals sub-folders. You'll asked to "Overwrite?" , just say yes. It'll change nothing.

copy/pate the supplied /Sounds folder directly over your existing /Sounds folder allow the overwrite

That should cover it, go fly!

Other Notes and Nonsense:

See original readmes for all the stuff and things and so forth

the Mk.13 included here in, is the new one released on 5/27/2013. I just renamed it withOUT the spaces, as sometimes SF2 goes a bit ape-shit when there are uneeded spaces in folder and file names. For whatever reason!

could use a better FM, too
