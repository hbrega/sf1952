SF2 Avro Shakelton Pack by Veltro2k       7/27/2020

-For SF2, Any and All (Full Merged Reccomended)

This is the release package for the Avro Shakelton Martime Patrol Bomber and Airborne Early Warning aircraft. As such, it contains 2 complete aircraft:

Shakelton MR.2 Patrol Bomber and,
Shakelton Mk.2 AEW aircraft.


Skins on both are jpg. Serial numbers, while historically correct for the MR.2, should be considered 'generic' in nature, as they don't represent specific aircraft from any particular unit. The AEW, as only 11 were converted, are 100% historically accurate. Decal randomization is true.

Skins included are for:

Shackelton MR.2:
No.206 Sqdn, St.Eval
No.38 Sqdn, Luqa

Shackelton AEW:
No. 8 Sqdn, Lossiemouth

The MR.2 uses the SF2 'date switch' from 206 (early scheme) to 38 (later tropical scheme)
The AEW, as it was only used by 8 Squadron, has only the one skin; overall dark sea gray.

All items necesary are included in this package, exepting bombs for the MR.2; these use the stock 3rd Wire 540lb UK bombs.

When in game, you'll see on the aircrft selection drop-down list:

Shackleton MR.2
Shackleton Mk.2 AEW

As is always reccomended, unzip to a temp folder or your desktop to give easy access to the rest of this readme for it's install instructions. Might want to give the "Notes" section a read as well!


Happy Landings!

==========
To Install:

As always reccomended, unzip the "sf2_avro-shakelton_pack" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere that's easy to find.

Copy/Paste the /Objects folder DIRECTLY into the SF2 game install of choice's /Objects folder. It's already divided into the necessary sub-folders. You'll asked to "Overwrite?" , just say yes. It'll change nothing.

Copy/Paste the included Sounds folder DIRECTLY over your existing /Sounds folder. Allow the Overwrite.

That should cover it, go fly!

-------------------------------

= NOTES:

These are designed to fit into the "Naval Search" category of the game. As such, they will appear as picket aircraft on most terrains. 

The MR.2 has a standard (3W) ground mapping radar, and a working bombsight. The bombsight is a small modificaiton of Crusader's WW2 style, as seen on many of those aircraft. The AEW uses the easy avionics to give a full 360 degree sweep.

The template is available upon request.


Enjoy!
